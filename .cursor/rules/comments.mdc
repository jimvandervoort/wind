# Comments

When writing code comments, avoid duplicating variables in the comments as they are likely to change. For example:

```js
// dont:
// sleep for 100ms
sleep(100);

// do:
// timeout to let user contribute 
sleep(100)
```

```conf
# dont:
# SPA route support for /capetown, /tarifa, and /holland
location ~ ^/(capetown|tarifa|holland|myspots)$ {
  root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}

# do:
# SPA route support
location ~ ^/(capetown|tarifa|holland|myspots)$ {
  root   /usr/share/nginx/html;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
}
```
